# javascript-search-bar
This is a functioning search bar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In creating this search-bar, I used JSONPlaceholders REST API for testing. The fake data pulled from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users was used to generate random user data such as names and email addresses.
